# ICT Game - CPU Assembly Educational Game

An interactive web-based game designed to help students learn the fundamentals of computer architecture by simulating the assembly of a CPU. The game guides users through different phases of CPU assembly, including the installation of key components like RAM, GPU, HDD, and processor.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for students by simulating the assembly of a CPU using an engaging web-based game. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides a step-by-step guide for assembling various computer components and helps users understand their interaction and importance in the overall system.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Assembly Process**: Guide students through the assembly of a CPU, including components such as RAM, GPU, HDD, and processor.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML and CSS to create an intuitive, visually appealing user interface.
- **Educational Tool**: Designed for beginners in computer architecture, making complex concepts easier to understand through a visual and interactive format.
- **Component Overview**: Each HTML page is dedicated to a specific component (CPU, GPU, RAM, HDD) and provides insights into its role and assembly process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game elements, providing an appealing look and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic for interactions and guiding users through the assembly process.
  
## How to Play

1. Open the `Final.html` to start the CPU assembly process.
2. Step through different HTML pages like `GPU.html`, `HDD.html`, `RAM.html`, and `Processor.html` to learn about each component.
3. Follow the interactive instructions and assemble the CPU by placing the components in the right order.
4. At the end, the user will have assembled a fully functional CPU and learned about the interaction of various parts in the system.

## File Structure

- **HTML Files**:
  - `Final.html`: The final stage of CPU assembly.
  - `GPU.html`: Details and assembly steps for the GPU.
  - `HDD.html`: Instructions on integrating the HDD into the system.
  - `Initial.html`: Starting page of the game.
  - `Processor.html`: Step-by-step guide for assembling the processor.
  - `RAM.html`: Instructions on installing RAM into the system.

- **Images**: Various images representing CPU parts (e.g., i3, i5, Ryzen, etc.) and background images for each assembly step.
